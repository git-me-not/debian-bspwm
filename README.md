# bspwm-rice

if you use slim display manager just like me, don't forget to edit the xinitrc file and add "exec bspwm" in the end.

you can copy the file from /etx/X11/xinit/xinitrc to your home directory:

sudo cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc .xinitrc

or just simply edit the file from it's initial folder.

WM        = BSPWM
Bar       = Polybar
Launcher  = rofi
